NY Homeschool Regulations do not specify subject requirements for Kindergarten. 

However, the following subjects must be covered K-12: patriotism and citizenship; health education regarding alcohol, drug and tobacco misuse; highway safety and traffic regulations, including bicycle safety; and fire and arson prevention and safety. 

Therefore these are the only topics included in the model school for reporting purposes.
