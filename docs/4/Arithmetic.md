* Become familiar with factors and multiples within 100
* Generate and analyze mathematical patterns
* Generalize place value understanding for multi-digit whole numbers
* Understand that the digit in one place is 10 times what it would be in the place to the right
* Read and write multi-digit numerals
* Write numbers in expanded form to show place value of each digit (Example: 26,825 = 20,000 + 6,000 + 800 + 20 + 5)
* Round multi-digit numerals to any place
* Compare the values of numbers using the symbols <, > , and =

## Unit 2
* Use understanding of place value and properties of operations to perform multi-digit arithmetic problems
* Draw, identify, and define points, lines, line segments, rays, and angles
* Draw, recognize, and define parallel and nonparallel lines

* Identify different kinds of triangles; recognize right triangles
* Recognize and define lines of symmetry
* Compare and order numbers with different numerators and denominators
* Build fractions from unit fractions
* Decompose a fraction into a sum of fractions with the same denominator

## Unit 3
* Add and subtract mixed fractional numbers with like denominators
* Multiply fractions by whole numbers
* Solve word problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions
* Create visual models to represent and solve problems with fractions
* Express a fraction with denominator of 10 as an equivalent fraction with denominator of 100
* Use decimal notation for fractions with denominators 10 or 100
* Compare decimals to one hundredth
* Know relative sizes of units in metric and English systems
* Convert units to larger and smaller units

## Unit 4
* Solve word problems with time, distance, masses of objects, money, and temperature
