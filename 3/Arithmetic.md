# Arithmetic


## Unit 1
* Tell and write time to nearest minute
* Solve word problems involving addition and subtraction of time
* Measure and estimate liquid volumes and masses of objects
* Solve word problems involving four operations with masses or volumes
* Generate measurement data, measuring lengths to halves and fourths of an inch
* Understand how concepts of area relate to multiplication and to addition
* Recognize and measure perimeter
* Measure areas by counting unit squares
* Multiply side lengths to find areas of rectangles in real-world problems
* Recognize area as additive

## Unit 2
* Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving perimeters of polygons
* Use tiles and pictures to represent areas
* Understand that data are sets of individual numerical facts or measurements
* Interpret information and solve problems from data on graphs and tables
* Draw a picture graph or scaled bar graph to represent a set of data
* Understand products as total number of objects in a number of same-size groups
* Understand quotients as the number of objects in each share when a total is equally partitioned
* Understand division as a problem of finding an unknown factor
* Know from memory all products of two one-digit numbers
* Apply commutative, associative, and distributive properties to multiply and divide

## Unit 3
* Multiply and divide fluently within 100
* Find unknown numbers in multiplication or division problems within 100
* Use drawings and equations with a symbol to represent an unknown number
* Solve two-step word problems involving the four operations
* Identify arithmetic patterns (5 times a number always ends in 5 or 0)
* Assess the reasonableness of answers (using estimation and mental calculation)
* Understand a fraction as a quantity formed when a whole is partitioned into equal parts
* Understand that a unit fraction (1/b) is the quantity formed by one part when the whole is partitioned into b equal parts
* Represent fractions on a number line diagram
* Compare fractions by reasoning about their size

## Unit 4
* Explain the concept of fraction equivalence
* Recognize and generate simple equivalent fractions
* Create models to show equivalent fractions
* Identify and describe a variety of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional shapes
* Understand that shapes in different categories may share attributes
* Understand that rectangles, rhombuses, squares, and trapezoids are all quadrilaterals
* Categorize shapes by their attributes
* Partition shapes into equal areas, describing each part as a unit fraction of the whole (for a shape partitioned into 6 parts with equal area, each part is 1/6 of the whole)
* Understand and use place value to 1,000
* Round numbers to the nearest 10 or 100
* Add and subtract within 1,000 using place value understandings
* Multiply one-digit whole numbers by multiples of 10
